# Hidden gesture
A Fun Observation Game for Kids
## Quick summary
3–4 players
Each has a tablet + 3 cards (2 face-up, 1 hidden)
Each tablet gives a secret mission.
A camera watches simple movements. 
Finish your mission without being detected. 
At the end, players vote,if nobody guesses your mission → you win.
## Players & time
- 3–4 players
- 1 round ≈ 3 minutes
- Easy, fast, repeatable
## Setup
Round table, Players sit evenly.
Each player gets 3 cards: 2 face-up in front of them, 1 hidden (under hand). Cards show only suits.
Each player has a tablet with privacy screen. Tablet camera faces the player.
Overhead projector shows the 3:00 timer and plays group audio (fun facts).
## The 4 missions
**Collector:** Get two cards of the same suit in front of you without anyone seeing.
**Watcher:** Catch someone cheating. If you think someone cheated, raise your hand quietly.
**Switcher:** Swap one of your cards with another player’s card without being seen.
**Fake Cheater:** Pretend to cheat (act like you are doing a sneaky move) but don’t actually change cards, make others think you’re cheating.
*These four are reused each round. They are simple and clear for 6-year-olds.*
## What the detector (tablet camera) can see
It only recognizes 3 basic movement types:
1. Looking side to side a lot - “suspicious glance”
2. Hands moving fast - “fast hands / swap-like motion”
3. Tapping on the table - “secret code tap”
Anything else (elbow move, fake cough, slow slide) passes **unnoticed**. That’s on purpose players must invent new tricks.
## What the detector does when it sees something
Plays a short sound.
Says out loud :
*“Player X might be spying!”* (if side-to-side)
*“Player X is moving hands quickly!”* (if fast hands)
*“Player X tapped a secret code!”* (if tap)
Immediately after, it reads a Fun Fact out loud for everyone (short sentence). 
Example:
“Fun fact: long ago, cheaters hid cards in sleeves!”
or “Fun fact: rounded card corners stop marking tricks.”
The tone is playful, not punitive it’s a learning bell everyone laughs, learns, and keeps playing.
# Fun facts 
Fun facts are triggered by detector events. So kids see/hear them at the moment of action tied to play.
Many fun facts are phrased like tiny “tips” so kids think it’s a game hint and look at the tablet, they read real history too. 
Example phrasing:
“Tip? Some players used to tap to signal actually, (it’s true ). 
Fun fact: rounded corners stop cheating.”
Because facts pop up during excitement, children don’t ignore them, they associate fun facts with action.
